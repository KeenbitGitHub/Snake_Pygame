* Redo a available_moves_left field (just needs to look pretier)
* Better crossover and mutation
* Needs to look diagonal

* Update the nn library on github so it includes load_weights() and so weights are chosen between -1 and 1 (not between 0 and 1)
* Look at weird warning (something with overflow)
* Add multithreading
