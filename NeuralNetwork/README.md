# Neural Network implementation from Scratch

## Introduction
This is an implementation of a fully-connected neural network from scratch in python.

## Overview
### Files
[NeuralNetwork.py](https://github.com/KeenbitGitHub/NeuralNetwork/blob/master/NeuralNetwork.py) Contains the class of the neural network.

[Hiddenlayer.py](https://github.com/KeenbitGitHub/NeuralNetwork/blob/master/HiddenLayer.py) Contains the class of a hidden layer and the input weights of to the layer.

[Inputlayer.py](https://github.com/KeenbitGitHub/NeuralNetwork/blob/master/InputLayer.py) Contains the class of an input layer.

### Functionality
Currently, the neural network only supports the sigmoid activationfunction and the squared mean error.

## User Guide
### Requirements
To use the implementation, you only need Python version 3.7.4 (or later) and NumPy version 1.18.1 (or later).

## Examples
### The XOR Problem
An example on how to use the implementation can be seen in [XOR.py](https://github.com/KeenbitGitHub/NeuralNetwork/blob/master/XOR.py), which solves the famous [XOR-problem](https://medium.com/@jayeshbahire/the-xor-problem-in-neural-networks-50006411840b).
